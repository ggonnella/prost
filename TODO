add more statistics
=> statistics from NCBI assembly report
=> what about the functional annotations?

allow to estimate taxid by rRNA
=> compute rRNA using barrnap and/or RNAmmer
=> classify 16S (using which program?)

use phenotype-based groups:
=> bacdive
=> other?

separate bacdive from the rest

statistics which are not single per genome?
