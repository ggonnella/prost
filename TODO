(1) numerical rule with one datapoint per genome
(2) taxonomic grouping

for each complete genome
  compute stat and store it in table genome_stats accession/statname/value


select taxid from ncbi_assembly_summary where accession = "GCF_904425475.1";


genome of interest, parentID
compute stat in tree under parentID
  and under each of the ancestors of parentID

by computing the taxIDs and collecting the corresponding genome_stat from genome_stats
