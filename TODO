(1) improve refseq_gff_analyzer plugin
(2) add gff handling to the snakefile
(3) run an update

add more statistics
=> statistics from NCBI assembly report
=> what about the functional annotations?

more comparison scripts
e.g. for absence/presence
     for low numbers (1-2-3 copies) does the current work?

use phenotype-based groups:
=> bacdive
=> other?

use environment-based groups:
=> e.g. from a 16s experiment?

=== this would be a good point for a presentation ===
GOAL: end of April

bacdive:
=> Use count in /api/bacdive/bacdive_id to
   check if there is new data
   => in this case, reload all lists
      and check if there are new IDs
      => sometimes reload all information,
         but this must be done explicitely
         since it's very slow
add information over the CC licences of PNU / Bacdive

complete genomes without bacdive records
  --> taxonomy ID
  --> can I connect them using NCBI taxonomy with Bacdive?
  --> how do I get the NCBI taxonomy ID?

allow to estimate taxid by rRNA
=> compute rRNA using barrnap and/or RNAmmer
=> classify 16S (using which program?)

PNU, is that useful?

direct loading into the DB? => but how many records
then into the computation table??? what if the computation breaks
etc

reduce redundancy of the data which is already loaded in the DB
